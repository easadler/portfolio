# Music Recommender
In order to solidify understanding of collaborative filtering, I decided to implement my own recommender from scratch, while the Octobor DSI Cohort worked on recommenders. After a google search for rating datasets, I stumbled upon this github [page](https://gist.github.com/entaroadun/1653794), which contains a compiled a list of over 20 different usable datasets for recommender projects. 

As a music lover who wouldn't mind future employment at a music related company, I settled on making music recommendations. Only two data sources were still intact (lastfm and yahoo!), however obtaining the Yahoo dataset required a weeklong verification process. Fortunately, lastfm's dataset had a good size of 1.4 gigabytes with approximately 360,000 users and the number of plays for their top ~60 artists. 

From the start, there are already some interesting problems that will need to be solved. The first is translating plays into a ranking. The distribution of plays will differ by user. Certain people may have a few favorite artists and others spread their time over many artists and genres. They may have only started listening to an artist at the time the data was extracted. Certain genres may be saturated with more famous artists than others, causing fans of those genres to have more uniform distributions. These and many other scenarios will need to be explored in the coming days.

Since we are only looking at top artists, we are automatically missing the artists that a user only listened to once because they didn't like them. These would be nice to have, but I bet that artists with few play counts are less indicative of a low rating than artists with high play counts are for a good rating. Without them, potentially a lot of noise is cut out and at least the dataset has been reduced, which will make this project more feasable given the time constrain. Hopefully, there are enough people with large musical pallets that can be leveraged for recommendations. The Jaccard similarity metric comes to mind as useful for this situation. Jaccardian similarity forgets rating and only considers the ratio of users who listened to both artists to those who listen to either:
